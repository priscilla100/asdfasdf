- For the **Atomic Proposition (Phrase) extraction** task uses the [nl2pl_finalized.csv](https://github.com/priscilla100/asdfasdf/blob/main/datasets/nl2pl_finalized.csv) dataset for the experiment.
- For the **Well-formed classification** task uses the [wff_data.csv](https://github.com/priscilla100/asdfasdf/blob/main/datasets/wff_data.csv) dataset.
- For the **Natural Language to LTL Translation** using the existing Little Tricky Logic from Greenman et al. [nl2ltl_finalized.csv](https://github.com/priscilla100/asdfasdf/blob/main/datasets/nl2ltl_finalized.csv) dataset is to be used.
- For the **Natural Language to LTL Translation** using the data collected from a collection of Computer Logic books then [textbook_data.csv](https://github.com/priscilla100/asdfasdf/blob/main/datasets/textbook_data.csv) dataset is to be used.
- For the **Trace Classification** task, the Little Tricky Logic data was given to NuSMV to generate a positive and negative for each respective LTL formula, which are randomized and can be found here for usage [randomized_positive_negative_trace.csv](https://github.com/priscilla100/asdfasdf/blob/main/datasets/randomized_positive_negative_trace.csv)
- For the **Trace Generation** task, the Little Tricky Logic from Greenman et al. [nl2ltl_finalized.csv](https://github.com/priscilla100/asdfasdf/blob/main/datasets/nl2ltl_finalized.csv) dataset is to be used.
- For the **Past LTL Synthesis** task, the Little Tricky Logic from Greenman et al., which was reformulated to have past verbs and modalities, was used in this experiment, and [past_ltl.csv](https://github.com/priscilla100/asdfasdf/blob/main/datasets/past_ltl.csv) dataset is to be used.
