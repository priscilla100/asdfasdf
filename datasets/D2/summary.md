$\mathbb{DS}_{2}^\mathsf{syntax}$

# Dataset source: Synthetically Generated via Context-Free Grammar

# Dataset used for Task: Well-Formed Formula (WFF) Identification

# Dataset Size: 299 (150 well-formed, 149 ill-formed)

# Dataset Format: CSV

This dataset is synthetically generated using a context-free grammar defining the syntax of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). It is designed to evaluate the LLMs' ability to distinguish between syntactically correct (well-formed) and incorrect (ill-formed) LTL formulas.

The dataset is a comma-separated list of the following pairs:
(LTL Formula String, Label)

- **LTL Formula String:** A string representing an LTL formula.
- **Label:** A binary label indicating its well-formedness: Yes for "well-formed" or No for "non-well-formed".

**Formula Complexity and Error Variety:**
Formulas vary in nesting depth (from simple atomic propositions up to 6 levels of operator nesting) and include diverse propositional, unary temporal, and binary temporal operators. Ill-formed formulas are systematically generated by injecting various syntactic errors (e.g., missing parentheses, incorrect operator arity, misplaced modalities, invalid atomic proposition names) at different depths, providing a robust test for syntactic understanding.
